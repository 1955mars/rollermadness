# Introduction

Roller madness is a third person roller ball controller game in which player has to navigate in a fixed area and collect coins that get spawned at random locations while avoiding the enemies that too spawn at random places. So that the roller ball movement looks like a mad person moving here and there. That's why this game is named as Roller Madness.

Watch the gameplay video of this game below.

For level 2, I have increased the game-play area and added more bumpers, coins & enemy spawners.

# Breakdown of final piece

The final gameplay goes like this

1. The player has to control the movement of the roller ball using WASD (Arrow) keys and collect coins while escaping from the enemy targets. The player shouldn't let the ball to go beyond the play area.
2. Game will be lost if either the ball falls down or hit by an enemy target.
3. The player has to collect 5 coins to win the level 1 and move to level2.
4. In level2, the player has to collect 10 coins to win the game.
5. If the game is won, the player can choose to restart the game all over again.

# Conclusion

I had lot of fun while building as well as playing this game. Most importantly, I have learnt how random generation of game objects can make the game-play unique every time.

# Next Steps..

If ever I get an opportunity to work on the version 2 of this game, I would like to add more game objects and more levels.
